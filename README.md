### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Prem! I'm a recent graduate of Case Western Reserve University, with a Master of Science in Physics. I'm interested in climate physics and understanding how anthropogenic climate change will impact human life in the future. My most recent project focused on understanding the meridional structure of the tropopause, and is in the process of publication!
