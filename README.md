### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Prem! I am a PhD student in the  Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences Department at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I am interested in interannual tropical variability and how we expect tropical variability to change in a warming climate. I am using the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6) models, which represent the cutting edge of climate models, to investigate how the El-NiÃ±o/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is projected to change. Through the application of Linear Inverse Modeling (LIM), we can get a handle on how ENSO dynamics are changing and provide a better understanding of what the future holds.
